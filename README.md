# Dapp-for-DEX
Decentralized application for decentralized exchange

## About
This is a full fledged project I've built for the DEX[from my repository]. It's my own version of the Decentralized Exchange on Ethereum, which allows users to deposit, withdraw, buy and sell their ERC20 tokens on the blockchain.

Each token is an ERC20 token - ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. Users of the DApp have to authenticate themselves first so that they can buy or sell their tokens in a non-custodial marketplace using cryptocurrency (ETH).


This dApp was built using:

* HTML 5
* Java script
* Bootstrap 5
* Solidity 0.8
* OpenZeppelin
* Truffle
* Ganache
* Web3.js
* MetaMask
